<h1>nikoidot</h1>

A startup that develop startups.

Nikoidot is a startup made up of passionate developers who focus on creating solutions and experiences. We are a small team with big plans, and our mission is to make improvements in the name of science, not money. We are proud to work with the community and engage with them. While we aim to create cheap and open-source projects, we do need to make money to maintain ourselves. However, one of our principles is "you don't have to pay for things that should be MVP."
